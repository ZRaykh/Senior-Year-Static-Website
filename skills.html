                <h3>My Skills as a Professional Photographer</h3>
                <p>
                    One of the skills I'm most proud of is my photography. 
                    I've been paid before to take photos for people at events and made it far on photo contests.
                    I prefer to take photos of nature or urban environments rather than people, but overtime people
                    began paying me to take photos for them and that skill grew!
                    <br> <br>
                    I use a <a href = https://www.usa.canon.com/shop/p/eos-rebel-t7-ef-s-18-55mm-f-3-5-5-6-is-ii?color=Black&type=New>Cannon Rebel T7</a> as my camera, 
                    but I am currently trying to upgrade to a new one. The right image is one of my photos.

                <p> Operating a camera itself isn't hard; however, finding the right angle and composition is. Everyone has their own style.
                    One more thing I wished I picked up earlier, was the necessity of editing. Editing makes your photos better and can take an average photographer
                    to a new level! For example:
