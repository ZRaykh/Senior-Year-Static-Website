            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            Hello! I'm Zachary and this is my first static website!
            Here you will some information about me, but I'll list the basics first!
            I'm the president of the school's poetry club and an event planner for the Calihraphy club!
            I also work at the <a href = "https://www.bklynlibrary.org"> Brooklyn Public Library </a>. 
            In my free time I love to hangout with friends, play video games, or take photos outside!
